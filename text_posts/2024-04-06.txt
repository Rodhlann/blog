I've finally got the RSS reader deployed and linked
on my timpepper.dev home page! 

Very excited to have finally figured out all the odds
and ends for getting it hosted. It was quite the journey!

I ended up having to rewrite both of my Auth and DB 
setups, which was unexpected and a little frustrating. 
If I end up liking this reader and wanting to continue
using it I'll probably end up trying again to host it
on either GCP or AWS for free or a small monthly fee. 

That would give me a lot more flexibility to host it and
build it out exactly how I want. I really just didn't
want to spend any money on the initial version.

Render is cool, but their non-free tiers immediately jump
up to $7+/mo, and I just can't imagine this little app
would cost that much to run. It's basically a static
page, a small DB and cache, and then some networking
to go out and get the actual RSS feeds. Very light
stuff. 

It's also hard to swallow the idea of paying streaming
service prices for something so little! 

My biggest gripe right now is that it doesn't seem like there's going to be
a good way for me to actually host the RSS reader at a 
route on my website, as of now. In order to do a reverse proxy I'd
need to be actually hosting my website as a web server somewhere
instead of statically hosting it through Github Pages. 

I might be able to set up my website DNS to point to the website
though? Maybe I could have like a rss-reader.timpepper.dev
page or something like that...

Either, way I'm glad to have a minimum viable product sort
of thing out there! I put a lot of work in to it and learned
a ton along the way. I'm hopeful I'll find it useful, and it
will be neat to share the RSS feeds I like with whoever
happens to stumble upon my website!
