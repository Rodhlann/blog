Well today was kind of a bust as far as coding goes!

I got super sidetracked randomly deciding to see if 
I could figure out how to implement an RSS reader. 
Why? I have no idea... I don't currently consume any
RSS feeds, and I don't publish a feed myself, so I
really can't say what drove me in that direction. 

Once that subsided I tried to go back and debug the
A* logic, but I'm finding that there's several layers
of issues there. 

The one thing I did figure out was that there seems
to be a compatibility issue between Chrome's 
for...of implementation and Safari / Firefox, where
the continue keyword doesn't work as expected. 

I was able to fix this by switching to a traditional
for loop, but that only illuminated another major issue where
for some reason in Chrome the algorithm appears to be
working backwards??? Instead of finding the shortest
possible path, it finds the longest! What!?

I have no idea why this is happening yet, but all of my
attempts to resolve it were thwarted. 

I guess every day can't be a winner! I think I'll probably
take a breather from the A* stuff for a day or two and
maybe try to get my home page looking a bit nicer.
