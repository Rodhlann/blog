Another day hacking away at this blog! I was hoping to have a bit more of a clean setup
for this repository, but I think it's fine as is for now.

I've got it set up so that I can just write my blog posts as plain text files and the blog
html is updated and generated on build. I was hoping to have it be a little more automated,
but I think that's a project for another day. As long as the merge to the main branch is
working! 

Narrator voice: "It was not working..."

Cool to finally get to work a bit with github actions, though I wish the docs were a little
more clear. Got spoiled with the Gitlab CI documentation!
