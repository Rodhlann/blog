Made some pretty good progress on my A* repository UI today. Didn't work on the actual
search logic at all, but now you can at least click around in the grid and add collision,
start, and end points. 

I actually had to solve a pretty fun math problem to get it working properly! Because the
grid is a 20x20 space, but the HTML canvas is 500x500 pixels, I needed a way to convert
between the two so I could manage the state. I've got it set up now so you can click anywhere
in the canvas and it will correctly update the grid state and cells accordingly! Nothing
too crazy, but I certainly feel good about not having to look up how to do it! 

Next steps will be fleshing out the UI so that I don't feel it constantly nagging at
me. Then I will be able to just focus on the search algorithm implementation. 

It's really exciting to have a place to put my work now with this Github pages setup! Usually 
I just power through something and it just ends up collecting dust in Github, or worse, my 
local computer, forever. 

But no longer!! I hope!
