Knocked out another rust project! This time I 
implemented the A* search algorithm with rust, which
is good news for my other A* search project!

I am trying to decide now whether I want to 
refactor the current JS code, which is pretty buggy,
or to try and figure out how to get my rust
implementation building as WASM. 

It might be worth doing both, and then comparing the
results!!

I'm certainly impressed with how quickly I can iterate
on my rust code. I'm experience some compiler headaches,
but once I've got those working the program is fast
and typically does what I expect it to do (assuming I 
don't make any programming errors!!). 

The rust community I have been exposed to is also very 
friendly and helpful, and it gives me hope that I can 
continue to learn the language with some support, 
instead of in isolation. 

I am excited to see what other stuff I can get up to 
with this new tool on my belt! I think I'd like 
to try and build a web server next, but I think I'll 
try and get to the end of rust's Book first, since
that's the final project in there. 

It's awesome to feel hyped on coding!! What a cool 
thing.
