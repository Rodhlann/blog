Been taking a minor break from the rss reader app development
while I think about where I want to go with it next. 

I have been pretty unhappy with the UX provided by
the Render free tier, and am not excited about the
idea of jumping immediately to $7+/mo payments to 
keep it alive. I have around 90 days to figure it out,
but I'm really thinking about buying a micro computer
to host some of these little projects I've been working
on instead of spending that money on cloud hosting. 

There's still a bunch of UI improvements I've been tossing
around, and I've even got some nearly completed. I think
it'll be pretty important to have category filtering in place
since the list UI is going to get pretty out of hand
as I continue to add new feeds. 

I'd also like a way for users to decide how long into
the past they'd like to see feed content. Day, week, month, etc. 
And some more in-depth options around how 
the content is actually laid out, whether it be by feed, 
as it currently is, or chronologically with the newest
posts first, or something. 

Definitely a lot of different options there! 

In the interim, while I'm still trying to figure all that out, I've
gone ahead and implemented my own RSS feed for this blog! Nothing
too exciting there, but I figure that pretty much closes
the loop on all this work I've been doing. 

I guess I'm hopeful that someone might stumble upon my
little website and find my efforts engaging in some way.  
Unlikely, I know, but at the very least it's another new thing 
I learned!
