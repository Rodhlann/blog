Took a quick detour from the A* algorithm workflow because
I was feeling like the blog was quickly getting a little
cluttered on the front page!

I am thinking it might be nice to have the 5 or so of my latest
posts on the front page, and then separate directories for
various topics I want to write about. 

So I completely rewrote my entire site build script, which was
pretty fun! 

Previously I was sort of inlining the entire process,
where I would get the text posts and then immediately write the
coinciding html document to the output dir. 

Now I am going out and building a directory tree which I can
iterate over to build the html documents and their index
pages. This makes it way easier to maintain, and to switch
directions in the future if I want, since all the posts now live 
in an isolated data structure. 

Been having a really fun time with it! I'm sure I will keep iterating
since this did introduce some awkward user flows...

Like if I add more topics, how will people know which posts are related
to what on the main blog page? How can I go about setting that up without
having to manually move files around all the time???

Exciting problems to have!
