Hey there, I'm Tim Pepper, a software developer living in the beautiful American North East.
I've been trying for a pretty long time to create a format for a blog I was happy with. 
There's something really special to me about the simplicty of a shell, and all of my most 
succesful dives in to journaling or writing have lived right inside of one.

I hope to continue using this project to create more blog related content. It's probably
just going to be coding project related talk or personal blather, but yelling to the void 
is pretty cathartic! I guess we'll see how long I can keep up with it.
