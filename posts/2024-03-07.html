<p>Another day hacking away at this blog! I was hoping to have a bit more of a clean setup
for this repository, but I think it's fine as is for now.</p>
<p>I've got it set up so that I can just write my blog posts as plain text files and the blog
html is updated and generated on build. I was hoping to have it be a little more automated,
but I think that's a project for another day. As long as the merge to the main branch is
working! </p>
<p>Narrator voice: "It was not working..."</p>
<p>Cool to finally get to work a bit with github actions, though I wish the docs were a little
more clear. Got spoiled with the Gitlab CI documentation! </p>
