<p>[Wed Apr 24 2024]</p>
<p>Knocked out another rust project! This time I 
implemented the A* search algorithm with rust, which
is good news for my other A* search project!</p>
<p>I am trying to decide now whether I want to 
refactor the current JS code, which is pretty buggy,
or to try and figure out how to get my rust
implementation building as WASM. </p>
<p>It might be worth doing both, and then comparing the
results!!</p>
<p>I'm certainly impressed with how quickly I can iterate
on my rust code. I'm experience some compiler headaches,
but once I've got those working the program is fast
and typically does what I expect it to do (assuming I 
don't make any programming errors!!). </p>
<p>The rust community I have been exposed to is also very 
friendly and helpful, and it gives me hope that I can 
continue to learn the language with some support, 
instead of in isolation. </p>
<p>I am excited to see what other stuff I can get up to 
with this new tool on my belt! I think I'd like 
to try and build a web server next, but I think I'll 
try and get to the end of rust's Book first, since
that's the final project in there. </p>
<p>It's awesome to feel hyped on coding!! What a cool 
thing. </p>
