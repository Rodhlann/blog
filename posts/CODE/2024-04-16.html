<p>[Tue Apr 16 2024]</p>
<p>Over the last several days I've been noticing
an issue loading certain feeds in the rss-reader.</p>
<p>It appears that feeds that are served as the contents
of a directory, rather than the actual file 
itself, regularly, but not always, fail to resolve in the fetch. 
This was perplexing, especially since I couldn't seem
to reproduce the issue locally, but it felt like I was
going to need to implement a retry strategy for 
feed fetching if I wanted to resolve the issue. </p>
<p>So that's what I did! I completely refactored the
feed fetch logic so I could modularize the actual
fetch and the rss-to-json parsing, which were
previously coupled together. This gave me the 
flexibility to build out the feed fetch retry. </p>
<p>Now in the event of a failure the service will retry, up 
to 5 times, to get the RSS feeds. If not it will
carry on as it had previously, logging and ignoring
the failure. </p>
<p>I was able to immediately test this upon merging
in to the main branch, and it seems to be working
great!! I am pretty psyched that the code was 
easy enough to break apart and iterate on. I am
pretty proud of myself for not writing a ball of 
mud (yet...). </p>
<p>In other news, I'm slowly making my way through
the Rust docs, and enjoying it very much. It's a
lot to take in! I have very little experience
with C, and next to none with C++, so this is really
my first dive in to lower level languages. Having
to think about memory allocation is completely 
new to me, especially, and as much as they are
easing me in I still feel pretty overwhelmed!</p>
<p>It's very exciting! Learning something new, that is...
I'm hopeful I will be able to build a small project
myself here soon. </p>
