<p>[Mon Mar 11 2024]</p>
<p>In my last post I mentioned that I had gotten my project / website structure up and running!
Well I was wrong! It was completely hosed, so I've gone ahead and completely rebuilt the whole
thing.</p>
<p>Previously I was just hosting a single Github Pages repository called `home-page` that just had
all my home page html and all the generator code for the blog in one place. I pretty rapidly
found that if I wanted to keep adding new projects and whatnot to my website that that solution
was going to scale horribly. Both because it was a lot to manage in one repo, but also because
I just wanted to have everything nice and compartmentalized. </p>
<p>At first I went and tried to create just another test repo and link it to my timpepper.dev domain, 
but Github didn't like that. I was pretty confused, but it seemed like it should just be that
easy!! It turns out it is that easy and I was just didn't read the docs at all... </p>
<p>So the way you're supposed to do it is by creating a repository for your root Github
Pages homepage, in my case a repo called rodhlann.github.com. Once that's ready you connect that up
with your custom domain (e.g. timpepper.dev), if you want. Once that's all set the new repo acts as 
your "home page", with whatever HTML document you put as the index.html in the root of that repo. </p>
<p>Then all of your Github Pages enabled repos just show up as routes for that home page! Pretty neat!</p>
<p>Once that was all set I went and broke out the blog in to its own repository, and got it all set up
and working as you see it now! Fantastic!</p>
<p>The next project I'm working on is a JS implementation of the A* search algorithm. This is something
I've been doing for a <a href="https://tic80.com/">TIC-80</a> game I'm working on, but I keep getting overwhelmed
and figure it's probably best to just do this part in isolation and then write it in to the game once
it's complete! </p>
<p>Hopefully will have some updates around that up soon, I just published the base UI I'll be using for
testing and displaying the logic, so yeah! </p>
<p>Peace! </p>
