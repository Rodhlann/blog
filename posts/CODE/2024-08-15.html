<p>[Thu Aug 15 2024]</p>
<p>You better believe I'm still procrastinating on my RSS Reader backend! 
It's okay though because I'm still doing some Rust learning / coding
in the mean time. </p>
<p>I kept hearing about people picking up the 2023 Advent of Code, which
isn't something I've heard of our thought about in a few years. What
a great opportunity to apply my limited Rust knowledge! </p>
<p>Day 1: Trebuchet</p>
<p>I was pretty impressed right away with this one. I don't do a lot of 
string parsing in my day-to-day, and creating a program to pull the
numbers out of a string, determine the first and last, and then add 
them was pretty fun. Definitely the type of scripting work I enjoy,
and don't get to do very much...</p>
<p>The second part was pretty awesome too! I have never intentionally 
written a multi-threaded program before, but this seemed like a neat
opportunity to try it out, given I was going to need to parse the same
data set twice. I also have struggled a bit so far to wrap my head
around the various Rust std lib thread tooling, so I have been looking
for some practical ways to apply that knowledge. In the end I was
able to parse the data sets concurrently, and mash the results together
into a correct answer! Over-engineered? Probably... Worth it? Definitely!</p>
<p>Day 2: Cube Conundrum</p>
<p>This challenge wasn't nearly as difficult or tricky. Most of the challenge
here was keeping track of string split levels, and dealing with some 
compiler errors I haven't experienced yet. In the end I was able to knock 
out both of the parts of this challenge in about an hour, which seemed
pretty good to me!</p>
<p>I would definitely like to keep running through these challenges, especially
if there's more tricky ones like Day 1. I imagine they only get more difficult
over time! It also gives me more opportunity to mess with the Rust std library,
where the personal projects I've been working on are more focused on using
external crates for a lot of the heavy lifting. </p>
<p>I'm still really loving Rust! There's definitely some moments where I'm 
pulling my hair out because I still don't fully understand the lifetimes
and borrow mechanics, but it is super satisfying writing a program that I can 
mostly trust (assuming there's no programmer error...), without any additional
fiddling. I'm also consistently impressed with the speed of my programs.
Unfortunately, with Node.js it's difficult to get micro-second level benchmarks on 
my functions, so getting to see these super quick run times in Rust is pretty
foreign, but satisfying! </p>
