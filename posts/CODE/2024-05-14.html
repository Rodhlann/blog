<p>[Tue May 14 2024]</p>
<p>It's been a bit! Took a quick trip to San Francisco
to check out the area and I didn't bring my laptop or 
anything. A nice break from the chaos! Time to get back 
to it now that I'm back home though...</p>
<p>Last night before I fell asleep I had a random idea
to try and re-implement my classic snake game learning
project, but with a twist! I wanted to see if I could
implement the snake game so that it would play autonomously
using the A* search algorithm I have been working on. </p>
<p>I'm not sure why I didn't think to try this before, it seems
like an ideal fit! It only took me a few hours to throw
together a proof of concept, and now I've got a fully autonomous 
snake game! It's very exciting! It's so awesome to be able to
take two different projects and merge them so successfully. </p>
<p>I think I could probably use the same strategy to make a 
Light Cycle sort of game in the future. Especially for online
play with bots or something along those lines. </p>
<p>In it's current state, the game will just run until it gets stuck,
which happens well before an actual game over state. With the way
I have it written it will get stuck any time the snake cannot 
actively approach the apple. So if it boxes itself in, it won't
attempt to unbox itself even if it is technically possible. </p>
<p>I think figuring out the level of game logic that would be
required to unstick the snake quite a bit more
than I signed up for with this project, so I'll be leaving it
for another day. </p>
<p>It feels great to come back from after a break and bang out a 
project right away! I'm hopeful that will keep me motivated
as I get back in to rebuilding my rss reader project in Next.js
with a Rust backend! </p>
