<p>[Wed Apr 10 2024]</p>
<p>Been taking a minor break from the rss reader app development
while I think about where I want to go with it next. </p>
<p>I have been pretty unhappy with the UX provided by
the Render free tier, and am not excited about the
idea of jumping immediately to $7+/mo payments to 
keep it alive. I have around 90 days to figure it out,
but I'm really thinking about buying a micro computer
to host some of these little projects I've been working
on instead of spending that money on cloud hosting. </p>
<p>There's still a bunch of UI improvements I've been tossing
around, and I've even got some nearly completed. I think
it'll be pretty important to have category filtering in place
since the list UI is going to get pretty out of hand
as I continue to add new feeds. </p>
<p>I'd also like a way for users to decide how long into
the past they'd like to see feed content. Day, week, month, etc. 
And some more in-depth options around how 
the content is actually laid out, whether it be by feed, 
as it currently is, or chronologically with the newest
posts first, or something. </p>
<p>Definitely a lot of different options there! </p>
<p>In the interim, while I'm still trying to figure all that out, I've
gone ahead and implemented my own RSS feed for this blog! Nothing
too exciting there, but I figure that pretty much closes
the loop on all this work I've been doing. </p>
<p>I guess I'm hopeful that someone might stumble upon my
little website and find my efforts engaging in some way.  
Unlikely, I know, but at the very least it's another new thing 
I learned!</p>
