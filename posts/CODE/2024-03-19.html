<p>[Tue Mar 19 2024]</p>
<p>I haven't merged the code to my main branch yet, but I've 
made some serious progress on the A* algorithm logic!!</p>
<p>I now have the UI populating with output from the algorithm
that displays the general search pattern up to the end point.
I would like to refine it a bit to show the most direct path
as well as some information about the searched area. </p>
<p>There's also still a bit of additional work that needs to be
done on the logic itself before I'll be ready to merge. </p>
<p>Firstly, it's not always successful. If I try to get it to find an end
point within a nearly blocked off space it can some times go
indefinitely without finding a route. With only 400 cells 
that seems like a bug more than anything else. </p>
<p>It's also pretty slow, I think there's a lot I can do to improve
performance, especially after seeing other examples online.</p>
<p>I'd also like to improve the UX by giving a user the ability to
drag to place cells instead of clicking, which feels pretty
tedious in it's current state. </p>
<p>Overall I am very happy with my progress though! I have been
working on various iterations of this project for a few months
and it finally feels like I'm making it happen. The first time
I successfully generated a complex path that didn't get hung up
on anything obvious I was honestly kind of mind blown!!!</p>
<p>Really excited to be able to share my progress, even if it's
only with my future self. I think this is a pretty notable
moment of learning for myself! </p>
