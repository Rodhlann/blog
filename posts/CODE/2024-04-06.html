<p>[Sat Apr 06 2024]</p>
<p>I've finally got the RSS reader deployed and linked
on my timpepper.dev home page! </p>
<p>Very excited to have finally figured out all the odds
and ends for getting it hosted. It was quite the journey!</p>
<p>I ended up having to rewrite both of my Auth and DB 
setups, which was unexpected and a little frustrating. 
If I end up liking this reader and wanting to continue
using it I'll probably end up trying again to host it
on either GCP or AWS for free or a small monthly fee. </p>
<p>That would give me a lot more flexibility to host it and
build it out exactly how I want. I really just didn't
want to spend any money on the initial version.</p>
<p>Render is cool, but their non-free tiers immediately jump
up to $7+/mo, and I just can't imagine this little app
would cost that much to run. It's basically a static
page, a small DB and cache, and then some networking
to go out and get the actual RSS feeds. Very light
stuff. </p>
<p>It's also hard to swallow the idea of paying streaming
service prices for something so little! </p>
<p>My biggest gripe right now is that it doesn't seem like there's going to be
a good way for me to actually host the RSS reader at a 
route on my website, as of now. In order to do a reverse proxy I'd
need to be actually hosting my website as a web server somewhere
instead of statically hosting it through Github Pages. </p>
<p>I might be able to set up my website DNS to point to the website
though? Maybe I could have like a rss-reader.timpepper.dev
page or something like that...</p>
<p>Either, way I'm glad to have a minimum viable product sort
of thing out there! I put a lot of work in to it and learned
a ton along the way. I'm hopeful I'll find it useful, and it
will be neat to share the RSS feeds I like with whoever
happens to stumble upon my website! </p>
