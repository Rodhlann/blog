<p>After a serious battle and an entire auth rewrite
I've finally got my little rss-reader web app deployed!</p>
<p>I ended up going through several tools trying to figure
out how to deploy the dang thing without breaking the 
bank, and have currently landed on Render as the platform
of choice. I was really trying to get GCP working, but
it is just so heavy without really any additional benefit
to me for my hobby projects. </p>
<p>I think it'd be cool to have some parity between my home
projects and the technology I'm using at work, but it was
just such a pain!! It would start my app build and just hang
indefinitely. There's no clear build logs or anything, from
what I could tell, so it's just a black box. No thanks. </p>
<p>Though, if anyone happens to see this and knows why my Dockerfile might
not have been getting accepted by GCP feel free to open an issue
with your ideas on the rss-reader repo. It's very possible I
was missing something obvious. </p>
<p>This same can be said for FusionAuth. I ended up switching to Auth0
because they make it super easy (and free) to set up a small project,
and I have no way currently to self-host the FusionAuth docker setup.
Using their pre-built products in AWS or whatever was pretty pricey
too... Kind of a bummer, because I like the way they have their entry
level auth setup more tbh. </p>
<p>Anyways, this is the first time I've deployed a web application
completely solo and from scratch! Pretty exciting stuff!</p>
<p>I think there's a lot to learn yet, and I feel like I could
probably get more out of other existing services, but right
now I'm just trying to get things figured without spending
a bunch of money on something where I will likely be the only
user. </p>
<p>I think once I'm done checking off the final things I want to tackle 
for this project, I'll probably try and set up an RSS feed for my
blog.</p>
<p>And then back to the A* search algorithm! For real this time! </p>
