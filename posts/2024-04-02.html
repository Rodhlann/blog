<p>[Tue Apr 02 2024]</p>
<p>I've done it! Mostly! I've got my rss-reader project
in to an almost deliverable state! </p>
<p>I solved two major problems today: </p>
<p>1. Handling both RSS spec and Atom spec 
feeds. This was a lot of fun to code for, and I was
glad to discover this little quirk about RSS readers.
I had no idea!</p>
<p>2. Figuring out how to give users the ability to
expand and collapse collapsible feed sections. 
This means that I can keep the UI in a pretty
standardized minimal state, but give users
the ability to read all the latest goodies from
the various feeds!</p>
<p>Really excited I was able to figure all of that out. 
It's been a long time since I've really had to build
something out from scratch, and getting to flex those
muscles feels really good. </p>
<p>Unfortunately, a few major problems remain! </p>
<p>In the process of fixing those two roadblocks, 
I ended up breaking my Rollup build. It seems like
the bundle isn't properly storing the public css 
and js files, so the UI can't load. I'm sure that's
something obvious I've just never had to deal with
before, but it was an unexpected surprise! </p>
<p>Secondly, I have collected all of these great RSS
feeds during development, but it's looking like
I might have to re-enter them manually in my prod
instance. I don't really have a good way of getting
at the feed urls I enter in to the DB currently, 
perhaps I'll add another endpoint that just spits
those out in a text format...</p>
<p>I also still need to figure out where and how I will
host this little project. I don't particularly want
to pay to host it, and I don't have a good local server
setup currently, so who knows how that'll end up. </p>
<p>Wow! I've learned a ton these last few weeks. What
a blast it has been! Can't wait to continue with 
this and other projects that are knocking around in 
my head. </p>
