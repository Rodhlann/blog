<p>[Wed Mar 06 2024]</p>
<p>The scope for this little website is ballooning a bit. </p>
<p>I want to try and keep track of various side projects here, 
and also give myself an attractive home page so I can share my work, 
or just show it off to friends and family, or just keep a log of what
I'm doing for myself, even.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, I am no UI developer... Which I think is plain to see,
both in the current state of my home page, as well as with the design
of my blog. I think that's okay!! I can't expect to be immediately
good at everything, or immediately happy with everything I create. 
But I do hope to have this in a presentable state eventually!</p>
<p>Wish me luck! </p>
