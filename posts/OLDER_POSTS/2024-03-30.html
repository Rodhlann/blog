<p>[Sat Mar 30 2024]</p>
<p>It's been a few days since I've posted! I have been
pretty deep in the murk trying to figure out how
to get that rss-feed idea I had mentioned working. </p>
<p>It's pretty cool! I'm using Typescript, which has been
a bit painful to configure, but overall helpful. Rollup
to build and bundle, which is pretty neat (also painful to configure
because Typescript...). I am using a SQLite DB to store
various RSS feeds I want to display, and then rendering
them in a pretty standard feed UI using SSR, which I am currently
building entirely from scratch instead of with Next or another framework. 
And all the API routes to add and remove feeds are hidden behind the
admin UI page.</p>
<p>I've got the admin UI set up with an authentication 
using FusionAuth locally to keep it
protected from ??? strangers ??? who might stumble upon my 
super tiny unimportant website! ... Honestly, I mostly did this part 
as a learning project for stuff I'm doing at work, but it's 
still cool and I did learn a ton. </p>
<p>It's been an incredible learning experience, from figuring
out how RSS feeds work, to learning about authentication flows,
and learning how to do SSR without framework assistance. 
I'm feeling pretty accomplished and inquisitive!</p>
<p>Now I just need to finish up the UI and then figure out how
and where I want to host the dang thing. But I'm anticipating
having it as another route on my website!</p>
<p>Maybe I'll even set up an RSS feed for my blog so I can 
pretend someone is hearing (reading?) my shouts in to void!!!</p>
<p>Anyways, I'm hoping I'll get this to a good state soon
so I can get back to the A* search algorithm. </p>
<p>I found this article about 
<a href="https://romgrk.com/posts/optimizing-javascript">Optimizing JavaScript</a>
that I am super excited to learn from for performance
gains in that code. </p>
<p>Lots of inspiration these days! I hope I can keep riding this
wave!!!</p>
