<p>[Sat Mar 23 2024]</p>
<p>Finally merged in the first major iteration of the A* Search Algorithm
logic!!! Very exciting stuff.</p>
<p>It's definitely not perfect though. Currently if you create a complex search
path, like a pattern where the end point is inside of a room with a single
entrance and the start point is against the far wall of the room, 
it will freeze up and hang your browser. I put a warning for this up
on the page in the mean time at least...</p>
<p>I believe that's a bug in the current code where it's re-searching
already searched nodes. I'm not sure how else it would get stuck
in an infinite loop... But I'm confident I can figure it out!</p>
<p>Despite the flaws it's still pretty cool! I've got it set up now so you
can drag to place start and end points, as well as draw walls instead of
having to individually click cells, and it all updates dynamically, 
which feels much better. I also cleaned up the code a lot, which is one
of my great joys. Still a ways to go there yet, ha!</p>
<p>Very excited to have made it this far with the logic, and I plan on 
digging back in to it and maybe looking at some other implementations
to figure out how I might improve on what I've got. </p>
<p>I have no interest in cheating my way to the end though, so I'm hoping I 
can at least get it in to an unbroken state before I start optimizing
based off other people's code! </p>
