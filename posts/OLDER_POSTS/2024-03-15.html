<p>[Fri Mar 15 2024]</p>
<p>Just did a pretty big UI update for the A* search page. It's not super pretty
yet, but it does have all the general functionality I'd expect a test / demo
UI for something similar to have. </p>
<p>It's kind of funny because I always
have these grand ideas for how a web page should or could look, and then when
I get in to setting it up the vision just disappears. I honestly have no idea
how I will go about making this look better... but I think that's fine for now.</p>
<p>Also, I really really dislike working with CSS! It's always such a pain, and 
I feel like no matter how much time I put in to learning it I am never really
improving. I doubt there's anything better for the job out there, but boy I 
wish there was! </p>
<p>Anyways, next dev session will be starting work on the A* logic!! Very exciting
stuff. I haven't actually decided how I will display the path yet, but that
shouldn't be too hard once I get in to the thick of it.
