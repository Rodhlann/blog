<p>[Sun Apr 14 2024]</p>
<p>Ended up starting my Rust journey this weekend! 
(I know... I keep saying I am going to working on the A*
project and then getting distracted... I'll get to it!)</p>
<p>I worked through <a href="https://tourofrust.com">https://tourofrust.com</a>
over a few hours, which was super helpful and a much better ease-in to
Rust than the official docs, I think. And then started the 
official <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/rust-by-example/">Rust By Example</a>
guide! It's been pretty productive, and I'm hopeful I'll make
it through the guide and official Book over the next few weeks. </p>
<p>I also spent today tracking down a bunch of Ocean related
RSS feeds, and fixing the minor issues that came up in my 
rss-reader code alongside those new feeds. I was really 
happy to see that my logging was helpful! And I've improved
it even further now for future hiccups. </p>
<p>The book I'm reading, <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/en/book/show/63241875">The Underworld by Susan Casey</a>,
has been leaving a very strong impression on me, and I'm super
interested in learning more about Deep Sea Exploration and 
Ocean Conservation topics! All very exciting and interesting stuff!
It's been really fun finding all the good blogs, and their associated
feeds, and I can't wait to learn more!</p>
<p>Last thing: I've added an RSS link to the blog header! that
took a pretty long time because I was picky about how the 
link icon looked, but I'm excited to advertise my RSS feed,
even if no one sees it! It seems like finding feeds is kind
of a pain these days, so it's cool to have a link front and center. </p>
